Instructions to Compile for ARM Targets
----------------------------------------
The Codesourcery g++ compiler for arm platforms is required. It is based on gcc
(they push changes into gcc a couple times a year), get the latest EABI version
from:

    http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm

Note: grab the linux binaries for targeting the EABI platform; there are also
linux binaries for targeting the linux platform).

I unzip the archive ("TAR") version into a place like
~/bin/arm-gcc-codesourcery and then add the bin/ directory within that to my
$PATH in ~/.profile, then check that arm-none-eabi-gcc and others are in my
path.

You will also need to have dfu-util installed (on Linux) or compiled and placed
in a folder "dfu-util/" at the same level as the maple-library folder (macosx
and windows).

Write your program using src/main.cpp as the entry point. Then just 'make' and follow the directions!
