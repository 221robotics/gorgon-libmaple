Board portability is implemented by adding a header file to ./libmaple with the
name of the BOARD target, and then editing libmaple.h to add this file as an
option.

A pin maple file should be added to ./notes describing the pin numbering

ADC Notes:
    only using ADC1?
    untested

EXTI Notes:
    need to update huge table in comments?
    untested

NVIC Notes:
    I don't think NVIC_ISER3 and NVIC_ICER3 actually exist?
    Only CANBUS and USB OTG use interrupts above #63, but I updated the nvic code anyways

RCC Notes:
    Added some clock stuff to all boards even though they aren't usable... blah.

SPI Notes:
    SPI3 is only in XL chips so didn't really handle that

TIMER Notes:
    High-density devices add an advanced timer (TIMER8) and another normal one (TIMER5).
    TIMER6 and TIMER7 are much less useful.
    There is some partial progress towards adding timer5/timer8 functionality,
    but not much. This should probably all be rewritten.

USART Notes:
    The USART/UART nomeclature is a little mixed up.
